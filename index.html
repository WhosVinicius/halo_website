							<h1>Usage:</h1>
							<h2>After adding the executable to path, you can run it via the terminal, like this:</h2>
							<h2>halo "example.txt"</h2>
							<p>
								After opening the file, you will notice that you can't type anything. That is because the editor opens in Normal Mode,
								a mode for navigating the file. You can move the cursor with the WASD keys, or the keyboard arrow keys to move 5 lines
								down or up a time.
							</p>
